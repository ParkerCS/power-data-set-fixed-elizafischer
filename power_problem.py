Use the power_data.csv file AND the zipcode database
to answer the questions below.  Make sure all answers
are printed in a readable format. (i.e. "The city with the highest electricity cost in Illinois is XXXXX."

The power_data dataset, compiled by NREL using data from ABB,
the Velocity Suite and the U.S. Energy Information
Administration dataset 861, provides average residential,
commercial and industrial electricity rates by zip code for
both investor owned utilities (IOU) and non-investor owned
utilities. Note: the file includes average rates for each
utility, but not the detailed rate structure data found in the
OpenEI U.S. Utility Rate Database.

This is a big dataset.
Below are some questions that you likely would not be able
to answer without some help from a programming language.
It's good geeky fun.  Enjoy

FOR ALL THE RATES, ONLY USE THE BUNDLED VALUES (NOT DELIVERY).  This rate includes transmission fees and grid fees that are part of the true rate.
